```

## Installation

To get started with the Stock Price Prediction Web Application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Pre-trained Model:**
   Ensure you have the LSTM model saved in the `model/` directory as `stock_price_model.h5`.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the application:

1. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. **Explore the Features:**
   - Use the **Predict Next Day Price** button to forecast stock prices based on user input.
   - Check **See Live Prices** for current stock data and trends.
   - Access **Historical Stock Price Data** to analyze past stock performance.

## How It Works

The Stock Price Prediction Web Application employs a sophisticated workflow to provide users with accurate predictions:

1. **User Input:** The user enters a stock symbol for prediction.
2. **Data Retrieval:** The application fetches historical stock data using the YFinance API.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** The retrieved data is scaled and prepared for the LSTM model.
4. **Prediction:** The LSTM model processes the last 60 days of data to predict the next day's opening and closing prices.
5. **Results Display:** The application presents the predicted prices and visualizations to the user.

## Model Architecture

The heart of this application is the LSTM model, designed to capture patterns in time series data. Key features include:

- **Multiple LSTM Layers:** The model consists of stacked LSTM layers that allow it to learn complex patterns in the data.
- **Dropout Regularization:** Dropout layers are included to prevent overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.
- **Optimized Training:** The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset from 2010 to the present, fine-tuning weights to minimize prediction errors.

## Visualization

To enhance user experience, the application generates interactive charts that provide visual context for the stock prices:

- **Today's Close Price History:** A chart that visualizes today's closing prices over time.
- **Opening and Closing Prices:** A comparative chart that displays the opening and closing prices for the last 30 days.
- **Historical Trends:** Users can explore historical data trends with custom date range charts.
